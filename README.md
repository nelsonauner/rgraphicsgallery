rgraphicsgallery
================

This is a complete redesign of the R Graphics Gallery. 

- [ ] The site will be static, probably using jekyll
- [ ] Submissions of graphics will be github pull requests
- [ ] Submission data will consist of an R source file, with metadata embedded in comments
- [ ] Graphics will be generated travis when the code changes

Contributions of graphics to the gallery has always been difficult and hand crafted. With proper tools, we can leverage github and travis to build a much nicer R Graphics Gallery, facilitating contributions. 

I'm currently rather in a blue sky mode about this project. So if you have ideas, please express them in an [issue](https://github.com/romainfrancois/rgraphicsgallery/issues) or fork this repo and make some pull request.
